CRA app generated with [create react app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
This is the backend for the Create React Blog I made using MongoDB and Jest for testing. It is a simple blog that was an opportunity for me to reinforce my understanding of how to implement a an app using Node JS and Mongo DB. The build folder comes from another frontend app that was bundled. The source code for the frontend can be found here: https://github.com/seano424/blog_with_mongo_frontend.

This is a project blog MVP that uses a structure similar to the Rails apps I hade made: in which there are controllers, models, and the 'view' is the build folder from which the frontend lives. The focus is to better understand authentication, setting up a MongoDB app, and utilizing separate apps for the frontend and backend.
